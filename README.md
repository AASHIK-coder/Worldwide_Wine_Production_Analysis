# Worldwide Wine Production Analysis

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of worldwide wine production trends, spanning from the year 1835 to 2022. Utilizing a rich dataset, the analysis uncovers patterns, compares production across leading countries, and forecasts future production trends. Designed for researchers, wine industry stakeholders, and data enthusiasts, this analysis provides valuable insights into the global dynamics of wine production.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

### Installation
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook, then install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy pmdarima statsmodels
```

### Dataset
The dataset encompasses annual wine production volumes across various countries from 1835 to 2022. Data includes total world production and country-specific outputs.

## Analysis Outline

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Load the wine production dataset.
- Clean the dataset to handle missing values and standardize formats.

### Data Visualization
- Generate bar charts to display the top 5 wine-producing countries in the latest year available.
- Plot historical wine production trends for selected countries (Italy, France, Spain).

### Time Series Forecasting
- Implement the ARIMA model to forecast future wine production for the top producing countries.

## Key Findings
- **Top Producers:** The analysis identifies the top wine-producing countries and their production trends over recent years.
- **Production Trends:** Comparative analysis across selected countries showcases their historical production dynamics.
- **Forecasting:** Future production trends are forecasted, offering insights into expected changes in global wine production.

## Conclusion
The "Worldwide Wine Production Analysis" project leverages historical data to highlight significant trends in wine production, revealing the leading contributors to global wine output and predicting future production rates. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for understanding the past, present, and future of wine production on a global scale.
